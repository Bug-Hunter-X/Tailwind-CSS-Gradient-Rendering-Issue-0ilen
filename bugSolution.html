```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-blue-600 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This solution adds `via-blue-600` to the gradient for a smoother transition and ensures that all classes are applied correctly with proper spacing.  Additionally, verify your Tailwind CSS configuration and that there are no conflicting styles in your CSS or in any parent containers.  If using a CSS framework alongside Tailwind, ensure they don't have overriding styles.
