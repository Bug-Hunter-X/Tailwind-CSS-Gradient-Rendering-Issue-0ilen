```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. However, if the `bg-gradient-to-r` class is not applied correctly or there's a conflict with other styles, it might not render the gradient as expected.
