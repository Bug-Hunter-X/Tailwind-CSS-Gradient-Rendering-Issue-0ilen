# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue
This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Tailwind CSS gradients where the gradient might not render correctly. This can be due to various reasons, such as incorrect class application or conflicts with other styles.

## Bug Description
A gradient applied using `bg-gradient-to-r` from blue to purple doesn't render properly.  The gradient might be missing, partially visible, or rendered unexpectedly.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing the order of classes, ensuring no conflicting styles are applied, and double-checking the Tailwind CSS configuration to make sure gradients are enabled and configured correctly.
